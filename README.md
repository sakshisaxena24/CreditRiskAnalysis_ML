Credit Risk Analysis

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/data. We will work with “train_data.csv” and “train_labels.csv”.

Steps performed:

1. Data cleaning
2. Data preprocessing- One hot encoding and level encoding
3. Data Sampling into Train and Test
4. Model building using XGBoost
5. Grid Search on XGBoost
6. Feature Selection
7. Model Building using Neural Networks
8. Grid Search on Neural Networks
9. Strategy Building by best model (Found on basis of AUC scores)
10. SHAP Analysis on XGBoost features
11. Graphical Analysis of both models
